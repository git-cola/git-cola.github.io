.SH CONFIGURE YOUR EDITOR
.sp
The editor used by \fICtrl\-e\fP is configured from the Preferences screen.
The environment variable \fI$VISUAL\fP is consulted when no editor has been
configured.
.sp
\fIProTip\fP: Configuring your editor to \fIgvim \-f \-p\fP will open multiple tabs
when editing files.  \fIgvim \-f \-o\fP uses splits.
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP is {vim, emacs, textpad, notepad++}\-aware.
When you select a line in the \fIgrep\fP screen and press any of
\fIEnter\fP, \fICtrl\-e\fP, or the \fIEdit\fP button, you are taken to that exact line.
.sp
The editor preference is saved in the \fIgui.editor\fP variable using
\fI\%git config\fP\&.
.SH KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP has many useful keyboard shortcuts.
.sp
You can see the available shortcuts by pressing the \fB?\fP key,
choosing \fBHelp \-> Keyboard shortcuts\fP from the main menu,
or by consulting the \fI\%git cola keyboard shortcuts reference\fP\&.
.SH TOOLS
.sp
The \fIgit cola\fP interface is composed of various cooperating tools.
Double\-clicking a tool opens it in its own subwindow.
Dragging it around moves and places it within the window.
.sp
Tools can be hidden and rearranged however you like.
\fIgit cola\fP carefully remembers your window layout and restores
it the next time it is launched.
.sp
The \fIControl\-{1, 2, 3, ...}\fP hotkey gives focus to a specific tool.
A hidden tool can be re\-opened using the \fITools\fP menu or
the \fIShift+Control\-{1, 2, 3, ...}\fP shortcut keys.
.SH STATUS
.sp
The \fIStatus\fP tool provides a visual analog to the
\fI\%git status\fP command.
.sp
\fIStatus\fP displays files that are \fImodified\fP relative to the staging area,
\fIstaged\fP for the next commit, \fIunmerged\fP files from an in\-progress merge,
and files that are \fIuntracked\fP to git.
.sp
These are the same categories one sees when running
\fI\%git status\fP
on the command line.
.sp
You can navigate through the list of files using keyboard arrows as well
as the ergonomical and vim\-like \fIj\fP and \fIk\fP shortcut keys.
.sp
There are several convenient ways to interact with files in the \fIStatus\fP tool.
.sp
Selecting a file displays its diff in the \fI\%DIFF\fP viewer.
Double\-clicking a file stages its contents, as does the
the \fICtrl\-s\fP shortcut key.
.sp
\fICtrl\-e\fP opens selected files in the conifgured editor, and
\fICtrl\-d\fP opens selected files using \fI\%git difftool\fP
.sp
Additional actions can be performed using the right\-click context menu.
.SS Actions
.sp
Clicking the \fIStaged\fP folder shows a diffstat for the index.
.sp
Clicking the \fIModified\fP folder shows a diffstat for the worktree.
.sp
Clicking individual files sends diffs to the \fIDiff Display\fP\&.
.sp
Double\-clicking individual files adds and removes their content from the index.
.sp
Various actions are available through the right\-click context menu.
Different actions are available depending a file\(aqs status.
.SS Stage Selected
.sp
Add to the staging area using \fI\%git add\fP
Marks unmerged files as resolved.
.SS Launch Editor
.sp
Launches the configured visual text editor
.SS Launch Difftool
.sp
Visualize changes using \fIgit difftool\fP\&.
.SS Revert Unstaged Edits
.sp
Reverts unstaged content by checking out selected paths
from the index/staging area
.SS Revert Uncommited Edits
.sp
Throws away uncommitted edits
.SS Unstage Selected
.sp
Remove from the index/staging area with
\fI\%git reset\fP
.SS Launch Merge Tool
.sp
Resolve conflicts using \fI\%git mergetool\fP\&.
.SS Delete File(s)
.sp
Delete untracked files from the filesystem.
.SS Add to .gitignore
.sp
Adds untracked files to to the .gitignore file.
.SH DIFF
.sp
The diff viewer/editor displays diffs for selected files.
Additions are shown in green and removals are displayed in light red.
Extraneous whitespace is shown with a pure\-red background.
.sp
Right\-clicking in the diff provides access to additional actions
that use either the cursor location or text selection.
.SS Staging content for commit
.sp
The \fB@@\fP patterns denote a new diff hunk.  Selecting lines of diff
and using the \fIStage Selected Lines\fP command will stage just the selected
lines.  Clicking within a diff hunk and selecting \fIStage Diff Hunk\fP stages the
entire patch diff hunk.
.sp
The corresponding opposite commands can be performed on staged files as well,
e.g. staged content can be selectively removed from the index when we are
viewing diffs for staged content.
.SH COMMIT MESSAGE EDITOR
.sp
The commit message editor is a simple text widget
for entering commit messages.
.sp
You can navigate between the \fISubject\fP and \fIExtended description...\fP
fields using the keyboard arrow keys.
.sp
Pressing enter when inside the \fISubject\fP field jumps down to the
extended description field.
.sp
The \fIOptions\fP button menu to the left of the subject field
provides access to the additional actions.
.sp
The \fICtrl+i\fP keyboard shortcut adds a standard "Signed\-off\-by: " line,
and \fICtrl+Enter\fP creates a new commit using the commit message and
staged content.
.SS Sign Off
.sp
The \fISign Off\fP button adds a standard:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Signed\-off\-by: A. U. Thor <a.u.thor@example.com>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
line to the bottom of the commit message.
.sp
Invoking this action is equivalent to passing the \fB\-s\fP option
to \fI\%git commit\fP\&.
.SS Commit
.sp
The commit button runs
\fI\%git commit\fP\&.
The contents of the commit message editor is provided as the commit message.
.sp
Only staged files are included in the commit \-\- this is the same behavior
as running \fBgit commit\fP on the command\-line.
.SS Line and Column Display
.sp
The current line and column number is displayed by the editor.
E.g. a \fB5,0\fP display means that the cursor is located at
line five, column zero.
.sp
The display changes colors when lines get too long.
Yellow indicates the safe boundary for sending patches to a mailing list
while keeping space for inline reply markers.
.sp
Orange indicates that the line is starting to run a bit long and should
break soon.
.sp
Red indicates that the line is running up against the standard
80\-column limit for commit messages.
.sp
Keeping commit messages less than 76\-characters wide is encouraged.
\fI\%git log\fP
is a great tool but long lines mess up its formatting for everyone else,
so please be mindful when writing commit messages.
.SS Amend Last Commit
.sp
Clicking on \fIAmend Last Commit\fP makes \fIgit cola\fP amend the previous commit
instead of creating a new one.  \fIgit cola\fP loads the previous commit message
into the commit message editor when this option is selected.
.sp
The \fIStatus\fP tool will display all of the changes for the amended commit.
.SS Create Signed Commit
.sp
Tell \fIgit commit\fP and \fIgit merge\fP to sign commits using GPG.
.sp
Using this option is equivalent to passing the \fB\-\-gpg\-sign\fP option to
\fI\%git commit\fP and
\fI\%git merge\fP\&.
.sp
This option\(aqs default value can be configured using the \fIcola.signcommits\fP
configuration variable.
.SH APPLY PATCHES
.sp
Use the \fBFile \-> Apply Patches\fP menu item to begin applying patches.
.sp
Dragging and dropping patches onto the \fIgit cola\fP interface
adds the patches to the list of patches to apply using
\fI\%git am\fP\&.
.sp
You can drag either a set of patches or a directory containing patches.
Patches can be sorted using in the interface and are applied in the
same order as is listed in the list.
.sp
When a directory is dropped \fIgit cola\fP walks the directory
tree in search of patches.  \fIgit cola\fP sorts the list of
patches after they have all been found.  This allows you
to control the order in which patchs are applied by placing
patchsets into alphanumerically\-sorted directories.
.SH CUSTOM WINDOW SETTINGS
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP remembers modifications to the layout and arrangement
of tools within the \fIgit cola\fP interface.  Changes are saved
and restored at application shutdown/startup.
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP can be configured to not save custom layouts by unsetting
the \fISave Window Settings\fP option in the \fIgit cola\fP preferences.
.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
.sp
These variables can be set using \fIgit config\fP or from the settings.
.SS cola.browserdockable
.sp
Whether to create a dock widget with the \fIBrowser\fP tool.
Defaults to \fIfalse\fP to speedup startup time.
.SS cola.checkconflicts
.sp
Inspect unmerged files for conflict markers before staging them.
This feature helps prevent accidental staging of unresolved merge conflicts.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP\&.
.SS cola.fileattributes
.sp
Enables per\-file gitattributes encoding support when set to \fItrue\fP\&.
This tells \fIgit cola\fP to honor the configured encoding when displaying
and applying diffs.
.SS cola.fontdiff
.sp
Specifies the font to use for \fIgit cola\fP\(aqs diff display.
.SS cola.inotify
.sp
Set to \fIfalse\fP to disable inotify support.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP when the \fIpyinotify\fP module is available.
.SS cola.refreshonfocus
.sp
Set to \fItrue\fP to automatically refresh when \fIgit cola\fP gains focus.  Defaults
to \fIfalse\fP because this can cause a pause whenever switching to \fIgit cola\fP from
another application.
.SS cola.linebreak
.sp
Whether to automatically break long lines while editing commit messages.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP\&.  This setting is configured using the \fIPreferences\fP
dialog, but it can be toggled for one\-off usage using the commit message
editor\(aqs options sub\-menu.
.SS cola.dragencoding
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP encodes paths dragged from its widgets into \fIutf\-16\fP when adding
them to the drag\-and\-drop mime data (specifically, the \fItext/x\-moz\-url\fP entry).
\fIutf\-16\fP is used to make \fIgnome\-terminal\fP see the right paths, but other
terminals may expect a different encoding.  If you are using a terminal that
expects a modern encoding, e.g. \fIterminator\fP, then set this value to \fIutf\-8\fP\&.
.SS cola.readsize
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP avoids reading large binary untracked files.
The maximum size to read is controlled by \fIcola.readsize\fP
and defaults to \fI2048\fP\&.
.SS cola.savewindowsettings
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP will remember its window settings when set to \fItrue\fP\&.
Window settings and X11 sessions are saved in \fI$HOME/.config/git\-cola\fP\&.
.SS cola.signcommits
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP will sign commits by default when set \fItrue\fP\&. Defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
See the section below on setting up GPG for more details.
.SS cola.tabwidth
.sp
The number of columns occupied by a tab character.  Defaults to 8.
.SS cola.terminal
.sp
The command to use when launching commands within a graphical terminal.
.sp
\fIcola.terminal\fP defaults to \fIxterm \-e\fP when unset.
e.g. when opening a shell, \fIgit cola\fP will run \fIxterm \-e $SHELL\fP\&.
.sp
If either \fIgnome\-terminal\fP, \fIxfce4\-terminal\fP, or \fIkonsole\fP are installed
then they will be preferred over \fIxterm\fP when \fIcola.terminal\fP is unset.
.SS cola.textwidth
.sp
The number of columns used for line wrapping.
Tabs are counted according to \fIcola.tabwidth\fP\&.
.SS cola.color.text
.sp
The default diff text color, in hexadecimal RRGGBB notation.
Defaults to "030303".
.SS cola.color.add
.sp
The default diff "add" background color, in hexadecimal RRGGBB notation.
Defaults to "d2ffe4".
.SS cola.color.remove

\fIgit cola\fP avoids showing untracked files when set to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.SS gui.editor
.sp
The default text editor to use is defined in \fIgui.editor\fP\&.
The config variable overrides the VISUAL environment variable.
e.g. \fIgvim \-f \-p\fP\&.
.SS gui.historybrowser
.sp
The history browser to use when visualizing history.
Defaults to \fIgitk\fP\&.
.SS diff.tool
.sp
The default diff tool to use.
.SS merge.tool
.sp
The default merge tool to use.
.SS user.email
.sp
Your email address to be recorded in any newly created commits.
Can be overridden by the \(aqGIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL\(aq, \(aqGIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL\(aq, and
\(aqEMAIL\(aq environment variables.
.SS user.name
.sp
Your full name to be recorded in any newly created commits.
Can be overridden by the \(aqGIT_AUTHOR_NAME\(aq and \(aqGIT_COMMITTER_NAME\(aq
environment variables.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.SS GIT_COLA_TRACE
.sp
When defined, \fIgit cola\fP logs \fIgit\fP commands to stdout.
When set to \fIfull\fP, \fIgit cola\fP also logs the exit status and output.
When set to \fItrace\fP, \fIgit cola\fP logs to the \fIConsole\fP widget.
.SS VISUAL
.sp
Specifies the default editor to use.
This is ignored when the \fIgui.editor\fP configuration variable is defined.
.SH LANGUAGE SETTINGS
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP automatically detects your language and presents some
translations when available.  This may not be desired, or you
may want \fIgit cola\fP to use a specific language.
.sp
You can make \fIgit cola\fP use an alternative language by creating a
\fI~/.config/git\-cola/language\fP file containing the standard two\-letter
gettext language code, e.g. "en", "de", "ja", "zh", etc.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mkdir \-p ~/.config/git\-cola &&
echo en >~/.config/git\-cola/language
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively you may also use LANGAUGE environmental variable to temporarily
change \fIgit cola\fP\(aqs language just like any other gettext\-based program.  For
example to temporarily change \fIgit cola\fP\(aqs language to English:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
LANGUAGE=en git cola
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To make \fIgit cola\fP use the zh_TW translation with zh_HK, zh, and en as a
fallback.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
LANGUAGE=zh_TW:zh_HK:zh:en git cola
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH CUSTOM GUI ACTIONS
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP allows you to define custom GUI actions by setting \fIgit config\fP
variables.  The "name" of the command appears in the "Actions" menu.
.SS guitool.<name>.cmd
.sp
Specifies the shell command line to execute when the corresponding item of the
Tools menu is invoked. This option is mandatory for every tool. The command is
executed from the root of the working directory, and in the environment it
receives the name of the tool as GIT_GUITOOL, the name of the currently
selected file as FILENAME, and the name of the current branch as CUR_BRANCH
(if the head is detached, CUR_BRANCH is empty).
.SS guitool.<name>.background
.sp
Run the command in the background (similar to editing and difftool actions).
This avoids blocking the GUI.  Setting \fIbackground\fP to \fItrue\fP implies
\fInoconsole\fP and \fInorescan\fP\&.
.SS guitool.<name>.needsfile
.sp
Run the tool only if a diff is selected in the GUI. It guarantees that
FILENAME is not empty.
.SS guitool.<name>.noconsole
.sp
Run the command silently, without creating a window to display its output.
.SS guitool.<name>.norescan
.sp
Don’t rescan the working directory for changes after the tool finishes
execution.
.SS guitool.<name>.confirm
.sp
Show a confirmation dialog before actually running the tool.
.SS guitool.<name>.argprompt
.sp
Request a string argument from the user, and pass it to the tool through the
ARGS environment variable. Since requesting an argument implies confirmation,
the confirm option has no effect if this is enabled. If the option is set to
true, yes, or 1, the dialog uses a built\-in generic prompt; otherwise the
exact value of the variable is used.
.SS guitool.<name>.revprompt
.sp
Request a single valid revision from the user, and set the REVISION
environment variable. In other aspects this option is similar to argprompt,
and can be used together with it.
.SS guitool.<name>.revunmerged
.sp
Show only unmerged branches in the revprompt subdialog. This is useful for
tools similar to merge or rebase, but not for things like checkout or reset.
.SS guitool.<name>.title
.sp
Specifies the title to use for the prompt dialog.
Defaults to the tool name.
.SS guitool.<name>.prompt
.sp
Specifies the general prompt string to display at the top of the dialog,
before subsections for argprompt and revprompt.
The default value includes the actual command.
.SS guitool.<name>.shortcut
.sp
Specifies a keyboard shortcut for the custom tool.
.sp
The value must be a valid string understood by the \fIQAction::setShortcut()\fP API.
See \fI\%http://qt\-project.org/doc/qt\-4.8/qkeysequence.html#QKeySequence\-2\fP
for more details about the supported values.
.sp
Avoid creating shortcuts that conflict with existing built\-in \fIgit cola\fP
shortcuts.  Creating a conflict will result in no action when the shortcut
is used.
.SH SETTING UP GPG FOR SIGNED COMMITS
.sp
When creating signed commits \fIgpg\fP will attempt to read your password from the
terminal from which \fIgit cola\fP was launched.
The way to make this work smoothly is to use a GPG agent so that you can avoid
needing to re\-enter your password every time you commit.
.sp
This also gets you a graphical passphrase prompt instead of getting prompted
for your password in the terminal.
.SS Install gpg\-agent and friends
.sp
On Mac OS X, you may need to \fIbrew install gpg\-agent\fP and install the
\fI\%Mac GPG Suite\fP\&.
.sp
On Linux use your package manager to install gnupg\-agent and pinentry\-qt4, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo apt\-get install gnupg\-agent pinentry\-qt4
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Configure gpg\-agent and a pin\-entry program
.sp
Edit \fI~/.gnupg/gpg.conf\fP to include the line,:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
use\-agent
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Edit \fI~/.gnupg/gpg\-agent.conf\fP to contain a pinentry\-program line pointing to
the pin\-entry program for your platform.
.sp
The following example \fIgpg\-agent.conf\fP shows how to use pinentry\-qt4 on Linux:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pinentry\-program /usr/bin/pinentry\-qt4
default\-cache\-ttl 3600
enable\-ssh\-support
use\-standard\-socket
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This following example \fIgpg\-agent.conf\fP shows how to use MacGPG2\(aqs
pinentry app on On Mac OS X:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pinentry\-program /usr/local/MacGPG2/libexec/pinentry\-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry\-mac
default\-cache\-ttl 3600
enable\-ssh\-support
use\-standard\-socket
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once this has been setup then you will need to eval the output
of \fIgpg\-agent \-\-daemon\fP in your shell prior to launching git\-cola.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
eval $(gpg\-agent \-\-daemon)
bin/git\-cola
.ft P
