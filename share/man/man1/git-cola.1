.SH CONFIGURE YOUR EDITOR
.sp
The editor used by \fICtrl\-e\fP is configured from the Preferences screen.
.sp
The following environment variables are consulted when no editor is configured.
If defined, the first of these variables is used:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIGIT_VISUAL\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fIVISUAL\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fIGIT_EDITOR\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fIEDITOR\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI*VISUAL\fP variables are consulted before the \fI*EDITOR\fP variables so that you can
configure a graphical editor independently of the editor used by the Git CLI.
.sp
\fIProTip\fP: Configuring your editor to \fIgvim \-f \-p\fP will open multiple tabs
when editing files.  \fIgvim \-f \-o\fP uses splits.
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP is {vim, emacs, textpad, notepad++}\-aware.
When you select a line in the diff or grep screens and press any of
\fIEnter\fP, \fICtrl\-e\fP, or the \fIEdit\fP button, you are taken to that exact line.
.sp
The editor preference is saved in the \fIgui.editor\fP variable using
\fI\%git config\fP\&.
.SH KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP has many useful keyboard shortcuts.
.sp
Many of \fIgit cola\fP’s editors understand vim\-style hotkeys, eg. \fI{h,j,k,l}\fP
for navigating in the diff, status, grep, and file browser widgets.
.sp
\fI{d,u}\fP move down/up one half page at a time (similar to vim’s \fIctrl\-{d,u}\fP).
The \fIspace\fP and \fIshift\-space\fP hotkeys are mapped to the same operations.
.sp
\fIShift\-{j,k,d,u,f,b,page\-up,page\-down,left,right,up,down}\fP can be be used in
the diff editor to select lines while navigating.
.sp
\fIs\fP is a useful hotkey in the diff editor.  It stages/unstages the current
selection when a selection is present.  When nothing is selected, the
diff hunk at the current text cursor position is staged.  This makes it very
easy to review changes by selecting good hunks with \fIs\fP while navigating down
and over hunks that are not going to be staged.
.sp
\fICtrl\-u\fP in the diff editor reverts unstaged edits, and respects the
selection.  This is useful for selectively reverted edits from the worktree.
This same hotkey reverts the entire file when used from the status tool.
.sp
\fICtrl\-s\fP in the diff editor and status tools stages/unstages the entire file.
.sp
You can see the available shortcuts by pressing pressing the \fB?\fP key,
choosing \fBHelp \-> Keyboard shortcuts\fP from the main menu,
or by consulting the \fI\%git cola keyboard shortcuts reference\fP\&.
.SH TOOLS
.sp
The \fIgit cola\fP interface is composed of various cooperating tools.
Double\-clicking a tool opens it in its own subwindow.
Dragging it around moves and places it within the main window.
.sp
Tools can be hidden and rearranged however you like.
\fIgit cola\fP carefully remembers your window layout and restores
it the next time it is launched.
.sp
The \fIControl\-{1, 2, 3, …}\fP hotkey gives focus to a specific tool.
A hidden tool can be re\-opened using the \fITools\fP menu or
the \fIShift+Control\-{1, 2, 3, …}\fP shortcut keys.
.sp
The Diff editor can be focused with \fICtrl\-j\fP\&.
the Status tool can be focused with \fICtrl\-k\fP\&.
the Commit tool can be focused with \fICtrl\-l\fP\&.
.SH STATUS
.sp
The \fIStatus\fP tool provides a visual analog to the
\fI\%git status\fP command.
.sp
\fIStatus\fP displays files that are \fImodified\fP relative to the staging area,
\fIstaged\fP for the next commit, \fIunmerged\fP files from an in\-progress merge,
and files that are \fIuntracked\fP to git.
.sp
These are the same categories one sees when running
\fI\%git status\fP
on the command line.
.sp
You can navigate through the list of files using keyboard arrows as well
as the ergonomical and vim\-like \fIj\fP and \fIk\fP shortcut keys.
.sp
There are several convenient ways to interact with files in the \fIStatus\fP tool.
.sp
Selecting a file displays its diff in the \fI\%DIFF\fP viewer.
Double\-clicking a file stages its contents, as does the
the \fICtrl\-s\fP shortcut key.
.sp
\fICtrl\-e\fP opens selected files in the configured editor, and
\fICtrl\-d\fP opens selected files using \fI\%git difftool\fP
.sp
Additional actions can be performed using the right\-click context menu.
.SS Actions
.sp
Clicking the \fIStaged\fP folder shows a diffstat for the index.
.sp
Clicking the \fIModified\fP folder shows a diffstat for the worktree.
.sp
Clicking individual files sends diffs to the \fIDiff Display\fP\&.
.sp
Double\-clicking individual files adds and removes their content from the index.
.sp
Various actions are available through the right\-click context menu.
Different actions are available depending a file’s status.
.SS Stage Selected
.sp
Add to the staging area using \fI\%git add\fP
Marks unmerged files as resolved.
.SS Launch Editor
.sp
Launches the configured visual text editor
.SS Launch Difftool
.sp
Visualize changes using \fIgit difftool\fP\&.
.SS Revert Unstaged Edits
.sp
Reverts unstaged content by checking out selected paths
from the index/staging area
.SS Revert Uncommitted Edits
.sp
Throws away uncommitted edits
.SS Unstage Selected
.sp
Remove from the index/staging area with
\fI\%git reset\fP
.SS Launch Merge Tool
.sp
Resolve conflicts using \fI\%git mergetool\fP\&.
.SS Delete File(s)
.sp
Delete untracked files from the filesystem.
.SS Add to .gitignore
.sp
Adds untracked files to to the .gitignore file.
.SH DIFF
.sp
The diff viewer/editor displays diffs for selected files.
Additions are shown in green and removals are displayed in light red.
Extraneous whitespace is shown with a pure\-red background.
.sp
Right\-clicking in the diff provides access to additional actions
that use either the cursor location or text selection.
.SS Staging content for commit
.sp
The \fB@@\fP patterns denote a new diff hunk.  Selecting lines of diff
and using the \fIStage Selected Lines\fP command will stage just the selected
lines.  Clicking within a diff hunk and selecting \fIStage Diff Hunk\fP stages the
entire patch diff hunk.
.sp
The corresponding opposite commands can be performed on staged files as well,
e.g. staged content can be selectively removed from the index when we are
viewing diffs for staged content.
.SH COMMIT MESSAGE EDITOR
.sp
The commit message editor is a simple text widget
for entering commit messages.
.sp
You can navigate between the \fISubject\fP and \fIExtended description…\fP
fields using the keyboard arrow keys.
.sp
Pressing enter when inside the \fISubject\fP field jumps down to the
extended description field.
.sp
The \fIOptions\fP button menu to the left of the subject field
provides access to the additional actions.
.sp
The \fICtrl+i\fP keyboard shortcut adds a standard “Signed\-off\-by: ” line,
and \fICtrl+Enter\fP creates a new commit using the commit message and
staged content.
.SS Sign Off
.sp
The \fISign Off\fP button adds a standard:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Signed\-off\-by: A. U. Thor <a.u.thor@example.com>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
line to the bottom of the commit message.
.sp
Invoking this action is equivalent to passing the \fB\-s\fP option
to \fI\%git commit\fP\&.
.SS Commit
.sp
The commit button runs
\fI\%git commit\fP\&.
The contents of the commit message editor is provided as the commit message.
.sp
Only staged files are included in the commit – this is the same behavior
as running \fBgit commit\fP on the command\-line.
.SS Line and Column Display
.sp
The current line and column number is displayed by the editor.
E.g. a \fB5,0\fP display means that the cursor is located at
line five, column zero.
.sp
The display changes colors when lines get too long.
Yellow indicates the safe boundary for sending patches to a mailing list
while keeping space for inline reply markers.
.sp
Orange indicates that the line is starting to run a bit long and should
break soon.
.sp
Red indicates that the line is running up against the standard
80\-column limit for commit messages.
.sp
Keeping commit messages less than 76\-characters wide is encouraged.
\fI\%git log\fP
is a great tool but long lines mess up its formatting for everyone else,
so please be mindful when writing commit messages.
.SS Amend Last Commit
.sp
Clicking on \fIAmend Last Commit\fP makes \fIgit cola\fP amend the previous commit
instead of creating a new one.  \fIgit cola\fP loads the previous commit message
into the commit message editor when this option is selected.
.sp
The \fIStatus\fP tool will display all of the changes for the amended commit.
.SS Create Signed Commit
.sp
Tell \fIgit commit\fP and \fIgit merge\fP to sign commits using GPG.
.sp
Using this option is equivalent to passing the \fB\-\-gpg\-sign\fP option to
\fI\%git commit\fP and
\fI\%git merge\fP\&.
.sp
This option’s default value can be configured using the \fIcola.signcommits\fP
configuration variable.
.SS Prepare Commit Message
.sp
The \fBCommit \-> Prepare Commit Message\fP action or \fICtrl\-Shift\-Return\fP keyboard shortcut
runs the \fIcola\-prepare\-commit\-msg\fP hook if it is available in \fI\&.git/hooks/\fP\&.
This is a \fIgit cola\fP\-specific hook that takes the same parameters
as Git’s \fI\%prepare\-commit\-msg hook\fP
.sp
The hook is passed the path to \fI\&.git/GIT_COLA_MSG\fP as the first argument and the hook is expected to write
an updated commit message to specified path.  After running this action, the
commit message editor is updated with the new commit message.
.sp
To override the default path to this hook set the
\fIcola.prepareCommitMessageHook\fP \fIgit config\fP variable to the path to the
hook script.  This is useful if you would like to use a common hook
across all repositories.
.SH BRANCHES
.sp
The \fIBranches\fP tool provides a visual tree to navigate through the branches.
The tree has three main nodes \fILocal Branch\fP, \fIRemote Branch\fP and \fITags\fP\&.
Branches are grouped by their name divided by the character ‘/’.Ex:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
branch/feature/foo
branch/feature/bar
branch/doe
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Will produce:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
branch
    \- doe
    + feature
        \- bar
        \- foo
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Current branch will display a star icon. If current branch has commits
ahead/behind it will display an up/down arrow with its number.
.SS Actions
.sp
Various actions are available through the right\-click context menu.
Different actions are available depending of selected branch status.
.SS Checkout
.sp
The checkout action runs
\fI\%git checkout [<branchname>]\fP\&.
.SS Merge in current branch
.sp
The merge action runs
\fI\%git merge –no\-commit [<branchname>]\fP\&.
.SS Pull
.sp
The pull action runs
\fI\%git pull –no\-ff [<remote>] [<branchname>]\fP\&.
.SS Push
.sp
The push action runs
\fI\%git push [<remote>] [<branchname>]\fP\&.
.SS Rename Branch
.sp
The rename branch action runs
\fI\%git branch \-M [<branchname>]\fP\&.
.SS Delete Branch
.sp
The delete branch branch action runs
\fI\%git branch \-D [<branchname>]\fP\&.
.SS Delete Remote Branch
.sp
The remote branch action runs
\fI\%git push –delete [<remote>] [<branchname>]\fP\&.
.SH APPLY PATCHES
.sp
Use the \fBFile \-> Apply Patches\fP menu item to begin applying patches.
.sp
Dragging and dropping patches onto the \fIgit cola\fP interface
adds the patches to the list of patches to apply using
\fI\%git am\fP\&.
.sp
You can drag either a set of patches or a directory containing patches.
Patches can be sorted using in the interface and are applied in the
same order as is listed in the list.
.sp
When a directory is dropped \fIgit cola\fP walks the directory
tree in search of patches.  \fIgit cola\fP sorts the list of
patches after they have all been found.  This allows you
to control the order in which patches are applied by placing
patchsets into alphanumerically\-sorted directories.
.SH CUSTOM WINDOW SETTINGS
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP remembers modifications to the layout and arrangement
of tools within the \fIgit cola\fP interface.  Changes are saved
and restored at application shutdown/startup.
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP can be configured to not save custom layouts by unsetting
the \fISave Window Settings\fP option in the \fIgit cola\fP preferences.
.SH DARK MODE AND WINDOW MANAGER THEMES
.sp
Git Cola contains a \fBdefault\fP theme which follows the current Qt style and a
handful of built\-in color themes.  See \fI\%cola.theme\fP for more details.
.sp
To use icons appropriate for a dark application theme, configure
\fBgit config \-\-global cola.icontheme dark\fP to use the dark icon theme.
See \fI\%cola.icontheme\fP for more details.
.sp
On macOS, using the \fBdefault\fP theme will automatically inherit “Dark Mode”
color themes when configured via System Preferences.  You will need to
configure the dark icon theme as noted above when dark mode is enabled.
.sp
On Linux, you may want Qt to follow the Window manager theme by configuring it
to do so using the \fBqt5ct\fP Qt5 configuration tool.  Install \fBqt5ct\fP on
Debian/Ubuntu systems to make this work.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo apt install qt5ct
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once installed, update your \fI~/.bash_profile\fP to activate \fBqt5ct\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Use the style configured using the qt5ct tool
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This only work with the \fIdefault\fP theme.  The other themes replace the color
palette with theme\-specific colors.
.sp
Some systems may require that you override \fIQT_STYLE_OVERRIDE\fP in order to
use a dark theme or to better interact with the Desktop environment.
Some systems provide a theme that you can install:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo apt\-get install adwaita\-qt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can activate the theme using the following environment variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Override the default theme to adwaita\-dark
export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=adwaita\-dark
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIQT_STYLE_OVERRIDE\fP may already be set in your Desktop Environment, so check that
variable for reference if you get unexpected hangs when launching \fIgit\-cola\fP or
when the default theme does not follow the desktop’s theme on Linux.
.sp
If you don’t want to set this variable globally then you can set it when launching
cola from the command\-line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=adwaita\-dark git cola
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following is a user\-contributed custom \fIgit\-cola.desktop\fP file that can be used to
launch Git Cola with these settings preset for you:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Git Cola (dark)
Comment=The highly caffeinated Git GUI
TryExec=git\-cola
Exec=env QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=adwaita\-dark git\-cola \-\-prompt \-\-icon\-theme dark
Icon=git\-cola
StartupNotify=true
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Development;RevisionControl;
X\-KDE\-SubstituteUID=false
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You may also want to customize the diff colors when using a dark theme:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
git config \-\-global cola.color.add 86c19f
git config \-\-global cola.color.remove c07067
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Please see \fI\%#760\fP for more details.
.SS Custom Themes
.sp
To create your own custom theme for Git Cola just create a QSS file and put it in
\fB~/.config/themes/\fP\&. You can add as many files as you want. Each file will become
an option in \fBMenu \-> File \-> Preferences \-> Appearance \-> GUI theme\fP\&.
.sp
Some examples can be found here \fI\%Qt Style Sheets Examples\fP\&.
.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
.sp
These variables can be set using \fIgit config\fP or from the settings.
.SS cola.autocompletepaths
.sp
Set to \fIfalse\fP to disable auto\-completion of filenames in completion widgets.
This can speed up operations when working in large repositories.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP\&.
.SS cola.autoloadCommitTemplate
.sp
Set to \fItrue\fP to automatically load the commit template in the commit message
editor If the commit.template variable has not been configured, raise the
corresponding error.
Defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.SS cola.blameviewer
.sp
The command used to blame files.  Defaults to \fIgit gui blame\fP\&.
.SS cola.browserdockable
.sp
Whether to create a dock widget with the \fIBrowser\fP tool.
Defaults to \fIfalse\fP to speedup startup time.
.SS cola.checkconflicts
.sp
Inspect unmerged files for conflict markers before staging them.
This feature helps prevent accidental staging of unresolved merge conflicts.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP\&.
.SS cola.defaultrepo
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP, when run outside of a Git repository, prompts the user for a
repository.  Set \fIcola.defaultrepo\fP to the path of a Git repository to make
\fIgit cola\fP attempt to use that repository before falling back to prompting
the user for a repository.
.SS cola.dictionary
.sp
Specifies an additional dictionary for \fIgit cola\fP to use in its spell checker.
This should be configured to the path of a newline\-separated list of words.
.SS cola.expandtab
.sp
Expand tabs into spaces in the commit message editor.  When set to \fItrue\fP,
\fIgit cola\fP will insert a configurable number of spaces when tab is pressed.
The number of spaces is determined by \fIcola.tabwidth\fP\&.
Defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.SS cola.gravatar
.sp
Use the \fIgravatar.com\fP service to lookup icons for author emails.
Gravatar icons work by sending an MD5 hash of an author’s email to \fIgravatar.com\fP
when requesting an icon. Warning: this feature can leak information.
Network requests to \fIgravatar.com\fP are disabled when set to \fIfalse\fP\&.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP\&.
.SS cola.fileattributes
.sp
Enables per\-file gitattributes encoding and binary file support.
This tells \fIgit cola\fP to honor the configured encoding when displaying
and applying diffs.
.sp
A \fI\&.gitattributes\fP file can set the \fBbinary\fP attribute in order to force
specific untracked paths to be treated as binary files when diffing.
Binary files are displayed using a hexdump display.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Treat *.exr files as binary files.
*.exr binary
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS cola.fontdiff
.sp
Specifies the font to use for \fIgit cola\fP’s diff display.
.SS cola.hidpi
.sp
Specifies the High DPI displays scale factor. Set \fI0\fP to automatically scaled.
Setting value between 0 and 1 is undefined.
This option requires at least Qt 5.6 to work.
See \fI\%Qt QT_SCALE_FACTOR documentation\fP
for more information.
.SS cola.icontheme
.sp
Specifies the icon themes to use throughout \fIgit cola\fP\&. The theme specified
must be the name of the subdirectory containing the icons, which in turn must
be placed in the inside the main “icons” directory in \fIgit cola\fP’s
installation prefix.
.sp
If unset, or set either “light” or “default”, then the default style will be
used.  If set to “dark” then the built\-in “dark” icon theme, which is
suitable for a dark window manager theme, will be used.
.sp
If set to an absolute directory path then icons in that directory will be used.
This value can be set to multiple values using,
\fBgit config \-\-add cola.icontheme $theme\fP\&.
.sp
This setting can be overridden by the \fIGIT_COLA_ICON_THEME\fP environment
variable, which can specify multiple themes using a colon\-separated value.
.sp
The icon theme can also be specified by passing \fB\-\-icon\-theme=<theme>\fP on the
command line, once for each icon theme, in the order that they should be
searched.  This can be used to override a subset of the icons, and fallback
to the built\-in icons for the remainder.
.SS cola.imagediff.<extension>
.sp
Enable image diffs for the specified file extension.  For example, configuring
\fIgit config –global cola.imagediff.svg false\fP will disable use of the visual
image diff for \fI\&.svg\fP files in all repos until is is explicitly toggled on.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP\&.
.SS cola.inotify
.sp
Set to \fIfalse\fP to disable file system change monitoring.  Defaults to \fItrue\fP,
but also requires either Linux with inotify support or Windows with \fIpywin32\fP
installed for file system change monitoring to actually function.
.SS cola.refreshonfocus
.sp
Set to \fItrue\fP to automatically refresh when \fIgit cola\fP gains focus.  Defaults
to \fIfalse\fP because this can cause a pause whenever switching to \fIgit cola\fP from
another application.
.SS cola.linebreak
.sp
Whether to automatically break long lines while editing commit messages.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP\&.  This setting is configured using the \fIPreferences\fP
dialog, but it can be toggled for one\-off usage using the commit message
editor’s options sub\-menu.
.SS cola.maxrecent
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP caps the number of recent repositories to avoid cluttering
the start and recent repositories menu.  The maximum number of repositories to
remember is controlled by \fIcola.maxrecent\fP and defaults to \fI8\fP\&.
.SS cola.dragencoding
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP encodes paths dragged from its widgets into \fIutf\-16\fP when adding
them to the drag\-and\-drop mime data (specifically, the \fItext/x\-moz\-url\fP entry).
\fIutf\-16\fP is used to make \fIgnome\-terminal\fP see the right paths, but other
terminals may expect a different encoding.  If you are using a terminal that
expects a modern encoding, e.g. \fIterminator\fP, then set this value to \fIutf\-8\fP\&.
.SS cola.readsize
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP avoids reading large binary untracked files.
The maximum size to read is controlled by \fIcola.readsize\fP
and defaults to \fI2048\fP\&.
.SS cola.resizebrowsercolumns
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP will automatically resize the file browser columns as folders are
expanded/collapsed when \fBcola.resizebrowsercolumns\fP is set to \fItrue\fP\&.
.SS cola.safemode
.sp
The “Stage” button in the \fIgit cola\fP Actions panel stages all files when it is
activated and no files are selected.  This can be problematic if it is
accidentally triggered after carefully preparing the index with staged
changes.  “Safe Mode” is enabled by setting \fIcola.safemode\fP to \fItrue\fP\&.
When enabled, \fIgit cola\fP will do nothing when “Stage” is activated without a
selection.  Defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.SS cola.savewindowsettings
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP will remember its window settings when set to \fItrue\fP\&.
Window settings and X11 sessions are saved in \fI$HOME/.config/git\-cola\fP\&.
.SS cola.showpath
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP displays the absolute path of the repository in the window title.
This can be disabled by setting \fIcola.showpath\fP to \fIfalse\fP\&.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP\&.
.SS cola.signcommits
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP will sign commits by default when set \fItrue\fP\&. Defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
See the section below on setting up GPG for more details.
.SS cola.startupmode
.sp
Control how the list of repositories is displayed in the startup dialog.
Set to \fIlist\fP to view the list of repositories as a list, or \fIfolder\fP to view
the list of repositories as a collection of folder icons.
Defaults to \fIlist\fP\&.
.SS cola.statusindent
.sp
Set to \fItrue\fP to indent files in the Status widget.  Files in the \fIStaged\fP,
\fIModified\fP, etc. categories will be grouped in a tree\-like structure.
Defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.SS cola.statusshowtotals
.sp
Set to \fItrue\fP to display files counts in the Status widget’s category titles.
Defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.SS cola.tabwidth
.sp
The number of columns occupied by a tab character.  Defaults to 8.
.SS cola.terminal
.sp
The command to use when launching commands within a graphical terminal.
.sp
\fIcola.terminal\fP defaults to \fIxterm \-e\fP when unset.
e.g. when opening a shell, \fIgit cola\fP will run \fIxterm \-e $SHELL\fP\&.
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP has built\-in support for \fIxterm\fP, \fIgnome\-terminal\fP, \fIkonsole\fP\&.
If either \fIgnome\-terminal\fP, \fIxfce4\-terminal\fP, or \fIkonsole\fP are installed
then they will be preferred over \fIxterm\fP when \fIcola.terminal\fP is unset.
.sp
The table below shows the built\-in values that are used for the respective
terminal.  You can force the use of a specific terminal by configuring cola
accordingly.
.SS cola.terminalshellquote
.sp
Some terminal require that the command string get passed as a string.
For example, \fBxfce4\-terminal \-e "git difftool"\fP requires shell quoting,
whereas \fBgnome\-terminal \-\- git difftool\fP does not.
.sp
You should not need to set this variable for the built\-in terminals
cola knows about – it will behave correctly without configuration.
For example, when unconfigured, cola already knows that xfce4\-terminal
requires shell quoting.
.sp
This configuration variable is for custom terminals outside of the builtin set.
The table below shows the builtin configuration.

.SS cola.textwidth
.sp
The number of columns used for line wrapping.
Tabs are counted according to \fIcola.tabwidth\fP\&.
.SS cola.theme
.sp
Specifies the GUI theme to use throughout \fIgit cola\fP\&. The theme specified
must be one of the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIdefault\fP – default Qt theme, may appear different on various systems
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fIflat\-light\-red\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
If unset, or set to an invalid value, then the default style will be
used. The \fIdefault\fP theme is generated by Qt internal engine and should look
native but may look noticeably different on different platforms. The flat
themes on the other hand should look similar (but not identical) on various
systems.
.sp
The GUI theme can also be specified by passing \fB\-\-theme=<name>\fP on the
command line.
.SS cola.turbo
.sp
Set to \fItrue\fP to enable “turbo” mode.  “Turbo” mode disables some
features that can slow things down when operating on huge repositories.
“Turbo” mode will skip loading Git commit messages, author details, status
information, and commit date details in the \fIFile Browser\fP tool.
Defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.SS cola.color.text
.sp
The default diff text color, in hexadecimal #RRGGBB notation.
Defaults to “#030303”:

.SS core.hooksPath
.sp
Hooks are programs you can place in a hooks directory to trigger actions at
certain points in git’s execution. Hooks that don’t have the executable bit
set are ignored.
.sp
By default the hooks directory is \fB$GIT_DIR/hooks\fP, but that can
be changed via the \fBcore.hooksPath\fP configuration variable
.sp
The \fBcola\-prepare\-commit\-msg\fP hook functionality and Cola’s Git LFS
detection honors this configuration.
.sp
Please see the \fI\%git hooks documentation\fP
for more details.
.SS gui.diffcontext
.sp
The number of diff context lines to display.
.SS gui.displayuntracked
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP avoids showing untracked files when set to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.SS gui.editor
.sp
The default text editor to use is defined in \fIgui.editor\fP\&.
The config variable overrides the VISUAL environment variable.
e.g. \fIgvim \-f \-p\fP\&.
.SS gui.historybrowser
.sp
The history browser to use when visualizing history.
Defaults to \fIgitk\fP\&.
.SS diff.tool
.sp
The default diff tool to use.
.SS merge.tool
.sp
The default merge tool to use.
.SS user.email
.sp
Your email address to be recorded in any newly created commits.
Can be overridden by the ‘GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL’, ‘GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL’, and
‘EMAIL’ environment variables.
.SS user.name
.sp
Your full name to be recorded in any newly created commits.
Can be overridden by the ‘GIT_AUTHOR_NAME’ and ‘GIT_COMMITTER_NAME’
environment variables.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.SS GIT_COLA_ICON_THEME
.sp
When set in the environment, \fIGIT_COLA_ICON_THEME\fP overrides the
theme specified in the \fIcola.icontheme\fP configuration.
Read \fI\%cola.icontheme\fP for more details.
.SS GIT_COLA_SCALE
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIGIT_COLA_SCALE\fP should not be used with newer versions of Qt.
.sp
Set \fIQT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR\fP to \fI1\fP and Qt will automatically
scale the interface to the correct size based on the display DPI.
This option is also available by setting \fIcola.hidpi\fP configuration.
.sp
See the \fI\%Qt High DPI documentation\fP
for more details.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP can be made to scale its interface for HiDPI displays.
When defined, \fIgit cola\fP will scale icons, radioboxes, and checkboxes
according to the scale factor.  The default value is \fI1\fP\&.
A good value is \fI2\fP for high\-resolution displays.
.sp
Fonts are not scaled, as their size can already be set in the settings.
.SS GIT_COLA_TRACE
.sp
When defined, \fIgit cola\fP logs \fIgit\fP commands to stdout.
When set to \fIfull\fP, \fIgit cola\fP also logs the exit status and output.
When set to \fItrace\fP, \fIgit cola\fP logs to the \fIConsole\fP widget.
.SS VISUAL
.sp
Specifies the default editor to use.
This is ignored when the \fIgui.editor\fP configuration variable is defined.
.SH LANGUAGE SETTINGS
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP automatically detects your language and presents some
translations when available.  This may not be desired, or you
may want \fIgit cola\fP to use a specific language.
.sp
You can make \fIgit cola\fP use an alternative language by creating a
\fI~/.config/git\-cola/language\fP file containing the standard two\-letter
gettext language code, e.g. “en”, “de”, “ja”, “zh”, etc.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mkdir \-p ~/.config/git\-cola &&
echo en >~/.config/git\-cola/language
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively you may also use LANGUAGE environmental variable to temporarily
change \fIgit cola\fP’s language just like any other gettext\-based program.  For
example to temporarily change \fIgit cola\fP’s language to English:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
LANGUAGE=en git cola
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To make \fIgit cola\fP use the zh_TW translation with zh_HK, zh, and en as a
fallback.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
LANGUAGE=zh_TW:zh_HK:zh:en git cola
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH CUSTOM GUI ACTIONS
.sp
\fIgit cola\fP allows you to define custom GUI actions by setting \fIgit config\fP
variables.  The “name” of the command appears in the “Actions” menu.
.SS guitool.<name>.cmd
.sp
Specifies the shell command line to execute when the corresponding item of the
Tools menu is invoked. This option is mandatory for every tool. The command is
executed from the root of the working directory, and in the environment it
receives the name of the tool as GIT_GUITOOL, the name of the currently
selected file as FILENAME, and the name of the current branch as CUR_BRANCH
(if the head is detached, CUR_BRANCH is empty).
.sp
If \fB<name>\fP contains slashes (\fB/\fP) then the leading part of the name,
up until the final slash, is treated like a path of submenus under which the
actions will be created.
.sp
For example, configuring \fBguitool.Commands/Util/echo.cmd\fP creates a
\fBCommands\fP menu inside the top\-level \fBActions\fP menu, a \fBUtil\fP menu
inside the \fBCommands\fP menu and an \fBecho\fP action inside the \fBCommands\fP
submenu.
.SS guitool.<name>.background
.sp
Run the command in the background (similar to editing and difftool actions).
This avoids blocking the GUI.  Setting \fIbackground\fP to \fItrue\fP implies
\fInoconsole\fP and \fInorescan\fP\&.
.SS guitool.<name>.needsfile
.sp
Run the tool only if a diff is selected in the GUI. It guarantees that
FILENAME is not empty.
.SS guitool.<name>.noconsole
.sp
Run the command silently, without creating a window to display its output.
.SS guitool.<name>.norescan
.sp
Don’t rescan the working directory for changes after the tool finishes
execution.
.SS guitool.<name>.confirm
.sp
Show a confirmation dialog before actually running the tool.
.SS guitool.<name>.argprompt
.sp
Request a string argument from the user, and pass it to the tool through the
ARGS environment variable. Since requesting an argument implies confirmation,
the confirm option has no effect if this is enabled. If the option is set to
true, yes, or 1, the dialog uses a built\-in generic prompt; otherwise the
exact value of the variable is used.
.SS guitool.<name>.revprompt
.sp
Request a single valid revision from the user, and set the REVISION
environment variable. In other aspects this option is similar to argprompt,
and can be used together with it.
.SS guitool.<name>.revunmerged
.sp
Show only unmerged branches in the revprompt subdialog. This is useful for
tools similar to merge or rebase, but not for things like checkout or reset.
.SS guitool.<name>.title
.sp
Specifies the title to use for the prompt dialog.
Defaults to the tool name.
.SS guitool.<name>.prompt
.sp
Specifies the general prompt string to display at the top of the dialog,
before subsections for argprompt and revprompt.
The default value includes the actual command.
.SS guitool.<name>.shortcut
.sp
Specifies a keyboard shortcut for the custom tool.
.sp
The value must be a valid string understood by the \fIQAction::setShortcut()\fP API.
See \fI\%http://qt\-project.org/doc/qt\-4.8/qkeysequence.html#QKeySequence\-2\fP
for more details about the supported values.
.sp
Avoid creating shortcuts that conflict with existing built\-in \fIgit cola\fP
shortcuts.  Creating a conflict will result in no action when the shortcut
is used.
.SH SETTING UP GPG FOR SIGNED COMMITS
.sp
When creating signed commits, \fIgpg\fP will attempt to read your password from the
terminal from which \fIgit cola\fP was launched.
The way to make this work smoothly is to use a GPG agent so that you can avoid
needing to re\-enter your password every time you commit.
.sp
This also gets you a graphical passphrase prompt instead of getting prompted
for your password in the terminal.
.SS Install gpg\-agent and friends
.sp
On Mac OS X, you may need to \fIbrew install gpg\-agent\fP and install the
\fI\%Mac GPG Suite\fP\&.
.sp
On Linux use your package manager to install gnupg2,
gnupg\-agent and pinentry\-qt, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo apt\-get install gnupg2 gnupg\-agent pinentry\-qt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
On Linux, you should also configure Git so that it uses gpg2 (gnupg2),
otherwise you will get errors mentioning, “unable to open /dev/tty”.
Set Git’s \fIgpg.program\fP to \fIgpg2\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
git config \-\-global gpg.program gpg2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Configure gpg\-agent and a pin\-entry program
.sp
On Mac OS X, edit \fI~/.gnupg/gpg.conf\fP to include the line,:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
use\-agent
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is typically not needed on Linux, where \fIgpg2\fP is used, as
this is the default value when using \fIgpg2\fP\&.
.sp
Next, edit \fI~/.gnupg/gpg\-agent.conf\fP to contain a pinentry\-program line
pointing to the pinentry program for your platform.
.sp
The following example \fI~/.gnupg/gpg\-agent.conf\fP shows how to use
pinentry\-gtk\-2 on Linux:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pinentry\-program /usr/bin/pinentry\-gtk\-2
default\-cache\-ttl 3600
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This following example \fI\&.gnupg/gpg\-agent.conf\fP shows how to use MacGPG2’s
pinentry app on On Mac OS X:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pinentry\-program /usr/local/MacGPG2/libexec/pinentry\-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry\-mac
default\-cache\-ttl 3600
enable\-ssh\-support
use\-standard\-socket
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once this has been set up then you will need to reload your gpg\-agent config:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
echo RELOADAGENT | gpg\-connect\-agent
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you see the following output:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
OK
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then the daemon is already running, and you do not need to start it yourself.
.sp
If it is not running, eval the output of \fBgpg\-agent \-\-daemon\fP in your shell
prior to launching \fIgit cola\fP\&.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
eval $(gpg\-agent \-\-daemon)

.SH WINDOWS NOTES
.SS Git Installation
.sp
If Git is installed in a custom location, e.g. not installed in \fIC:/Git\fP or
Program Files, then the path to Git must be configured by creating a file in
your home directory \fI~/.config/git\-cola/git\-bindir\fP that points to your git
installation.  e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS SSH Agents for Key\-based Authentication
.sp
You may need to setup ssh\-agent in order to use SSH key\-based authentication
on Windows. It has been reported that starting OpenSSH agent in
Windows Services and adding the key using Powershell are necessary in order
to get things working.

.sp
\fI\%FIPS Security Mode\fP
is available in newer versions of Python. These include Python 3.9+ and the
patched Python 3.6 used by CentOS8/RHEL8 (and possibly others).
.sp
Git Cola uses the \fBhashlib.md5\fP function and adheres to the FIPS security
